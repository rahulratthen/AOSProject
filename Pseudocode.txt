Two types of messages:

Request(j,n)
	- j is node identifier
	- n is sequence number indicating that this is the (n+1)th request

Privelege(Q,LN)
	- Q is a queue of requesting nodes
 	- LN is an array of size N such that LN[j] is the sequence number of node j granted most recently

Node
	- Each node has a node identifier I
	- Each node has an array RN of size N which records the largest sequence number received from each of the other nodes
	- Each node has an array LN  of size N such that LN[j] is the sequence number of node j granted most recently
	- Each node has the queue Q of requesting nodes
	- Boolean to say whether or not you have token: HaveToken
	- Boolean to say whether or not you are requesting token: IsRequesting
	- Sequence number n (number of requests so far)

Algorithm
	a) When Request(j,n) message is received:
		- Update RN[j] = max(RN[j],n);
		- if(HaveToken)&&(!IsRequesting)&&(RN[j] = LN[j] + 1) then {HaveToken = FALSE; send Privelege(Q,LN) to node j;}
	b) When making a Request:
		- Set IsRequesting = TRUE;
		- if(!HaveToken)
			- RN[I] = RN[I] + 1;
			- Send Request(I,RN[I]) to all other nodes
			- Wait until Privelege(Q,LN) is received
			- Set HaveToken = TRUE
		- Enter Critical Section
	c) When leaving critical section:
		- LN[I] = RN[I];
		- For all other nodes j, if j is not already in Q and RN[j] = LN[j] + 1 then add j to the end of the Q
		- If the Q is not empty
			- Set HaveToken = FALSE;
			- Send Privelege(tail(Q),LN) to node that is in head(Q)
			
		- Set IsRequesting = FALSE;
